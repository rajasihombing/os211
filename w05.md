# Top 10 List of Week 05

1. [Explanation of Demand Paging](http://digitalthinkerhelp.com/demand-paging-in-os-operating-system-examples-advantages-working/)<br>
Demand paging is the process of loading the page into memory on demand (whenever page fault occurs) is known as demand paging.
Halaman ini menarik karena cukup ringkas dan lengkap, pada halaman ini juga memuat steps dan advantages dan dilengkapi dengan gambar.

2. [Page Fault](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/page-fault-handling-in-operating-system/)<br>
A page fault (sometimes called #PF, PF or hard fault) is a type of exception raised by computer hardware when a running program accesses a memory page that is not currently mapped by the memory management unit (MMU) into the virtual address space of a process.

3. [Page Replacement Algorithm and How to Implement It](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/page-replacement-algorithms-in-operating-systems/)<br>
The page replacement algorithm decides which memory page is to be replaced. The process of replacement is sometimes called swap out or write to disk. Page replacement is done when the requested page is not found in the main memory (page fault). On this page, you will find many different page replacement algorithms. 

4. [Belady Anomaly](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/beladys-anomaly-in-page-replacement-algorithms/)<br>
Béládys anomaly is the name given to the phenomenon where increasing the number of page frames results in an increase in the number of page faults for a given memory access pattern. Di website ini juga menjelaskan Reason of Beladys Anomaly secara lengkap yang membuat website ini menarik.

5. [Copy on Write](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/copy-on-write/)<br>
Copy on Write or simply COW is a resource management technique. One of its main use is in the implementation of the fork system call in which it shares the virtual memory(pages) of the OS.

6. [Allocation of Frames](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operating-system-allocation-frames/)<br>
Frame allocation algorithms are used if you have multiple processes; it helps decide how many frames to allocate to each process. You will find the two algorithms commonly used to allocate frames to a process on this page.

7. [Global Allocation vs Local Allocation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operating-system-allocation-frames/)<br>
The number of frames allocated to a process can also dynamically change depending on whether you have used global replacement or local replacement for replacing pages in case of a page fault. Global allocation, allows a process to select a victim frame from the set of all frames. Local replacement is a victim frame is selected from the set of frames allocated to this process. Website ini menarik karena menjelaskan secara ringkas mengenai global dan local allocation beserta advantage dan disadvantage nya masing-masing.

8. [What is Trashing and Why you Need to Know!](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/techniques-to-handle-thrashing/)<br>
Thrashing is a condition or a situation when the system is spending a major portion of its time in servicing the page faults, but the actual processing done is very negligible. Disini selain dijelaskan apa itu trashing, dijelaskan juga mengenai techniques to handle thrashing.

9. [Allocating Kernel Memory](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operating-system-allocating-kernel-memory-buddy-system-slab-system/#:~:text=A%20second%20strategy%20for%20allocating,objects%20of%20the%20same%20type.)<br>
There are two strategies for managing free memory that is assigned to kernel processes, buddy system and slab. Website ini sangat menarik karena menjelaskan secara lengkap tentang buddy system dan slab allocation yang disertakan dengan contoh, implementation dan benefitnya.

10. [Get to Know NUMA](https://www.motioncontroltips.com/what-is-non-uniform-memory-access-in-industrial-controls/)<br>
NUMA (non-uniform memory access) is a method of configuring a cluster of microprocessor in a multiprocessing system so that they can share memory locally, improving performance and the ability of the system to be expanded
